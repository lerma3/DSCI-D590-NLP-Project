<h2>About</h2>
<p class="about">As political parties have become more polarized, their ideological underpinnings have manifested
themselves in the ads. The advent of microtargeting in social media has made it easy for campaigns to
disseminate different messages to different groups. Consequently, campaign messaging has
transformed from a collective to an individual message.
This app processes nearly 41,000 ads to show you the most frequent keywords and sentiment for candidates running
for Senate in 2022. This app makes it easy to know what candidates are telling you and what tone they
are using to convey their messages.</p>

<h2>Data and Methods</h2>
<p class="about">The data were derived from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library" target="_blank">Meta’s ad library</a>. The data were collected over multiple days in 
October and November 2022. We limited the data to the 2022 calendar year which included about 41,000 ads. Next, we normalized the ad text 
by removing stop words, special characters, and numbers, stripped HTML tags, expanded contractions, made all text lower case, and lemmatized the text. The normalization
was performed using <a href="https://github.com/dipanjanS/text-analytics-with-python/tree/master/New-Second-Edition" target="_blank">Sarkar's text 
normalization script.</a>
<h3>Wordcloud</h3>
<p class="about">Using the normalized text, we applied <a href="https://www.learndatasci.com/glossary/tf-idf-term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency/" target="_blank">
term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)</a>, a statistical natural language processing technique, that measures the importance of a word in a 
larger body of text. We then plotted the importance of the 50 most important words in a candidate's body of ads in a wordcloud with larger fonts indicating 
a greater level of importance. The wordclouds were created using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/" target="_blank">wordcloud</a> package.</p>
<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
<p class="about">Sentiment analysis was applied to the corpus of normalized ad text. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v8i1.14550" target="_blank">
Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (VADER)</a> algorithm was used to calculate the sentiments. The distribution of the sentiments was then plotted
using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="blank">Matplotlib</a>.
